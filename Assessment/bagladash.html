      <h3> Why is Bagladesh so populated? </h3>
      <p>Bagladesh have a very fertile land that are extremely
        suitable forfarming, so the food production increases,
        people tend to give birth to more children. Another reason
      why bagladesh is over populated with people because of lack of
      educations, you'll find families with 8-11 children, and having 1-2 is rare.
      Nowadays education is avalible for everyone and it's better so people will only have 2 children
      because of better family planning.
