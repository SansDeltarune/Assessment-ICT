      <h3> Why is Ethopia so populated? </h3>
      <p> Many Ethopians believe that children are gifts from god due to
        cultural influence and lack of education. However, comparing to other
        countries, Ethiopia isn't cworded with people but only the population
        is growing rapidly due to the size of it's territory. The government
        are giving birth educations for the Ethiopians to reduce the birthrate.
