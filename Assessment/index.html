  <h3>Cause of overpopulation</h3>
    <p> <strong>1.More people are born then people die each day </strong><br>
        People does not die from diseases or strave to death easily unlike
        the time before industrial revolution, where medical and farming technology is in arrears. <br><br>
      <strong>  2.More people to overcome poverty </strong><br>
        Since tecnology had advanced so as the economy, more and more people does not live in extreme poverty since they can get money more easily to take care of themselves and family. Therefore, people tend to make more children
 since they have more money to spare <br><br>
      <strong> 3.Lack of family planning </strong><br>
        In less developed countries, women are less eduacated, therefore it's easy to make these women produce babies. On more developed countries, people don't know (or don't wanna to care) how much child did they want so they'll often produce too much

  <h3>Affects of overpopulation</h3>
    <p> <strong>1.Natural resource will be used rapidly as more people need them</strong> <br>
      Two people drink a cup of water faster then one person drinks it, same applies to overpopulation, as more people need more natural resource for their basic living, the more natural resource are collected and used rapidly, when this happens where the amount of resource dcreases, the price for basic living increases, so more serious poverty problem occurs. This is also cause conflicts and wars since people will then fight for resource.<br><br>
      <strong>2.People will live in crowd environment because there is no land for everyone</strong>
      As more people are born, more land are needed in order to satisfy their living. However, in some places such as Hong Kong where land spaces aren't much, people tend to live in overcrowded areas. <br><br>
      <strong>3.More people will be unemployed</strong> <br>
      As more people looking for jobs, avaliable spaces for jobs will decrease, therefore, the unemployed people will increase.</p>

  <h3>How can us help to solve this problem?</h3>
  <p><strong>1.Better family planning</strong><br>
    If you want to have children, be sure to plan how many you want, as a single child can be expensive, this also benefits you as it saves you a lot of money<br><br>
    <strong>2.Buy less unnecessary products</strong><br>
      The money can be instead used for helping people who live in poverty that caused by overpopulation</p>
